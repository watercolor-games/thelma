# `thelma`

`thelma` is the name of a character within The Peacenet who plays a very 
important role in the game's storyline. As are all other characters in 
The Peacenet, she is an AI.

This code is what powers her ability to naturally respond to you based on 
what you say, and how she feels about you. This code also powers all 
other NPCs in The Peacenet, in both Multiplayer and Singleplayer modes.

This algorithm is based off of the algorithm used by Kaizen from 
event[0]. You can see how it works in this short video.
